# 0x04. TypeScript

This project explores TypeScript fundamentals and how to use it in frontend development.  
Each task builds understanding of interfaces, classes, functions, and typing while using Webpack for bundling.

## Task 0 - Student Interface
- Defines a `Student` interface with `firstName`, `lastName`, `age`, and `location`.
- Creates two student objects and stores them in an array named `studentsList`.
- Uses Vanilla JavaScript to render a table showing each student’s first name and location.

## Setup
To build or run locally:
```bash
npm install
npm run build
